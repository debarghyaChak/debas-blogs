## Introduction

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout of multiple web pages all at once. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of CSS, including how to apply styles, the box model, and some common properties. Understanding CSS is essential for web development, as it allows developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

## What is CSS?

CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. It can control the color, font, spacing, and layout of elements on a page. By separating content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), you can maintain a cleaner codebase and make it easier to manage your website's design. CSS is not just about aesthetics; it also plays a crucial role in user experience and accessibility.

## The Importance of CSS

CSS is vital for several reasons. First, it enhances the visual appeal of web pages, making them more engaging for users. Second, it allows for responsive design, enabling websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This is particularly important in today's mobile-first world, where users access the internet from various devices. Third, CSS improves website performance by reducing the amount of HTML code needed for styling, leading to faster load times.

## How CSS Works

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. This is done through selectors, which can target elements based on their type, class, ID, or attributes. Once selected, styles can be applied using properties and values. For example, you can change the color of text, the size of fonts, and the spacing between elements. Understanding how CSS selectors work is fundamental to mastering CSS.

## Types of CSS

There are three main types of CSS: inline, internal, and external.

*   **Inline CSS:** This is applied directly within HTML elements using the `style` attribute. While convenient for small changes, it can clutter your HTML and make it harder to maintain.

    **Example:**

    ```html
    <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 2em;">This is a heading with inline styles</h1>
    ```

*   **Internal CSS:** This is defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. This allows you to group styles for a specific page and keep your HTML cleaner.

    **Example:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Website</title>
      <style>
        h1 {
          color: red;
          font-size: 2em;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>This is a heading with internal styles</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

*   **External CSS:** This is linked to an HTML document through a separate CSS file. This is the preferred method as it promotes code reusability and separation of concerns. You can style multiple pages with a single CSS file.

    **Example (HTML):**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Website</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>This is a heading using an external stylesheet</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    **Example (style.css):**

    ```css
    h1 {
      color: red;
      font-size: 2em;
    }
    ```

## The CSS Box Model

Understanding the box model is crucial for layout design. Every element on a webpage is a rectangular box, and the box model consists of content, padding, border, and margin. The content is the actual content of the box, where text and images appear. Padding is the space between the content and the border, while the border surrounds the padding and content. Margin is the space outside the border. Mastering the box model is essential for creating well-structured layouts.

## Common CSS Properties

CSS properties are the building blocks of styling. Some commonly used properties include:

*   `color`: Sets the text color of an element.
*   `background-color`: Sets the background color of an element.
*   `font-size`: Sets the size of the text in an element.
*   `margin`: Sets the margin around an element.
*   `padding`: Sets the padding around the content.
